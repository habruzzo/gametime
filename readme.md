backlog finish:
	-get game list from big fish?
	-fill out games db (migration tool)
	

combination of "personal" blog posts and "reviews"

tool that will get names of all games in my steam library ->
tool that will take this list -> collect data to fill out "game" object -> fill out "game" object -> add to "game" table

tool to scrape post entry from google sheets rubric
post plainly formatted series of questions and answers, like an interview. so 
SECTION(overall, art, game)
	HEADING(graphics, audio, etc)
	  question:
		my answer

i dont think i need the  database, actually. i need to think about storage/serving content. do i want things to be in the database? or do i want them to be stored on disk/build them each time or only once? 
build once
store online, in private github? and then download them onto memory
tool to build page from rubric
tool to save page into some storage
tool to load articles

review process:
fill out google sheet
replace commas with &
download as csv
parse csv to json
add post to list
load json into db

either add game to json or run game tool

improve tooling!
