	FAQ:
	<p class="question">Why does this site look kinda ugly?</p>
	<p class="answer">It looks kinda bad because I made it myself as a hobby. I'm not that great at UI because I don't like it very much. I think this looks good. If you are nice to me and offer kindly, I will happily take your suggestions for improvements. I reserve the right to reject them.</p>
