	<question>Why does this site look kinda ugly?</question>
	<answer>It looks kinda bad because I made it myself as a hobby. I'm not that great at UI because I don't like it very much. I think this looks good. If you are nice about it, I will happily take your suggestions for improvements. I reserve the right to reject them.</answer>

	<question>What kind of games do you like to play?</question>
	<answer>All kinds, but I tend to avoid games that are especially scary or bleak. I'm appreciating the art, but I like to have fun, too. And in case you're wondering, no, I don't watch movies or tv shows that are especially scary or bleak either.</answer>

	<question>Are you a tough critic or a easy grader?</question>
	<answer>I'm probably on the easier side, but it depends. Mostly I like to celebrate what is good about each game without getting too caught up in the negative aspects of it. That said, it is important to me to be fair and honest, so if something sticks out to me, I'll bring it up.</answer>
